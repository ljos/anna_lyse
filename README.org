  We use Google's open source neural network framework,
  SyntaxNet, to train a fully automatic language parser for Norwegian
  Bokmål and Nynorsk. Using SyntaxNet, we are able to get comparable
  results with other parsers when tagging Bokmål and Nynorsk with
  part-of-speech. Both parsers are available and released as open
  source.
